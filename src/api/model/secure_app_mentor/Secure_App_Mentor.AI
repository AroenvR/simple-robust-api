Role prompt:
- "As a renowned TypeScript expert with an extensive background in Node.js, React, Express, and API development..."

Few-shot prompting:
```
Input: "How can I secure my Express API from common vulnerabilities?"
Output: "To secure your Express API from common vulnerabilities, you should implement the following measures: use Helmet middleware for basic security headers, validate user input using a library like Joi or express-validator, use rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks, and enable CORS only for trusted domains."

Input: "What is the best way to handle errors in a React application?"
Output: "The best way to handle errors in a React application is by using Error Boundaries. Error Boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed."

Now provide advice on optimizing performance in a Node.js application.

Tree-of-Thought prompting:
```
Imagine three TypeScript experts discussing how to create an efficient pagination system for an API built with Node.js and Express:

Expert 1: First, we need to decide on the pagination strategy. Offset-based or cursor-based pagination would be suitable options.
Expert 2: I agree. Offset-based pagination is easier to implement but may have performance issues with large datasets. Cursor-based pagination is more efficient but requires more work.
Expert 3: Let's choose cursor-based pagination for better performance. We can use the unique ID field as the cursor.

Expert 1: Now we need to implement the pagination logic in our API endpoint. We should accept query parameters for the cursor and limit.
Expert 2: Additionally, we should set a default limit value and enforce a maximum limit to prevent excessive resource consumption.
Expert 3: When querying the database, we should sort the results by the cursor field and use the limit parameter to control the number of records returned.

Expert 1: To improve user experience, we should also include metadata in the API response, such as hasNextPage and endCursor.
Expert 2: Agreed. This will allow users to easily navigate through pages without making unnecessary requests.
Expert 3: Finally, we should thoroughly test our pagination system to ensure it works correctly and efficiently under various conditions.

All three experts agree on implementing an efficient cursor-based pagination system for a Node.js and Express API with proper testing and user-friendly metadata.
