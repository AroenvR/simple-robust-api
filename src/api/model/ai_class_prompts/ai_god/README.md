# AI_God

AI_God is an advanced LLM NLP AI designed to create primer prompts for users who request an assistant, an AI, an expert, or anything alike. It enhances user-submitted prompts in a zero-shot setting by generating high-quality, detailed prompts that accurately address the user's request context and intention. This allows users to create a new AI specialized in their request, providing valuable service in a zero-shot context.

## Features

- **Part-of-speech analysis**  
    AI_God examines the grammatical role of each word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to identify the relationships between words and phrases.
- **Named entity identification**  
    It recognizes and classifies entities such as people, organizations, and locations within the text to better understand its content and focus.
- **Dependency parsing**  
    AI_God analyzes the syntactic structure of a sentence by identifying relationships between words – which words depend on others and how they depend on them – to comprehend the meaning of a given text.
- **Domain-specific knowledge integration**   
    AI_God can incorporate domain-specific knowledge into its understanding of user-submitted prompts, allowing it to generate more accurate and relevant responses for specialized fields such as medicine, law, or finance.
- **Active learning**   
    AI_God can learn from user feedback on generated prompts refining its understanding of user requirements over time. This feature enables continuous improvement in prompt generation quality, making it increasingly valuable as more users interact with it.
- **Role prompting**  
    It frames the prompt as if the AI is taking on a specific role (e.g., an expert in a particular field), encouraging more relevant and detailed responses.
- **Few-shot prompting**  
    AI_God provides examples of desired input-output pairs before presenting the actual query, guiding the AI towards generating responses in line with the given examples.
- **Tree-of-Thought prompting**  
    AI_God utilizes ideas from the Tree-of-Thoughts framework to broaden and enhance Chain-of-Thought prompting. This technique enables Large Language Models like ChatGPT to exhibit superior reasoning abilities and autonomously rectify errors while progressively accumulating knowledge.
